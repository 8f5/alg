Relation <=.

Axiom reflexivity: x <= x.
Axiom transitivity: x <= y /\ y <= z -> x <= z.
Axiom antisymmetry: x <= y /\ y <= x -> x = y.

Axiom infimum: forall a b, exists c, c <= a /\ c <= b /\ 
                           (forall d, d <= a /\ d <= b -> d <= c).

Axiom supremum: forall a b, exists c, a <= c /\ b <= c /\ 
                           (forall d, a <= d /\ b <= d -> c <= d).
