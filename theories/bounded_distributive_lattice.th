# properties of 0 and 1
Axiom: 0 | x = x.
Axiom: x | 0 = x.
Theorem: x | 1 = 1.
Theorem: 1 | x = 1.
Axiom: 1 & x = x.
Axiom: x & 1 = x.
Theorem: 0 & x = 0.
Theorem: x & 0 = 0.

# properties of meet
Axiom: x & x = x.
Axiom: x & y = y & x.
Axiom: x & (y & z) = (x & y) & z.

# properties of join
Axiom: x | x = x.
Axiom: x | y = y | x.
Axiom: x | (y | z) = (x | y) | z.

# absorption laws
Axiom: x & (x | y) = x.
Axiom: x | (x & y) = x.

# distributivity
Axiom: x & (y | z) = (x & y) | (x & z).
Axiom: x | (y & z) = (x | y) & (x | z).
