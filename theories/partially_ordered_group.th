Constant 1.
Unary inv.
Binary *.
Relation <=.

Axiom: 1 * x = x.
Axiom: x * 1 = x.
Theorem: inv(1) = 1.
Theorem: inv(inv(x)) = x.
Axiom: x * inv(x) = 1.
Axiom: inv(x) * x = 1.
Axiom: (x * y) * z = x * (y * z).

Axiom: a <= b => a * c <= b * c.
Axiom: a <= b => c * a <= c * b.

Axiom reflexivity: x <= x.
Axiom transitivity: x <= y /\ y <= z -> x <= z.
Axiom antisymmetry: x <= y /\ y <= x -> x = y.
