# The theory of a lattice
signature:
   m : 2 # binary meet
   j : 2 # binary join

axioms:
   # properties of meet
   m(x,x) = x;
   m(x,y) = m(y,x);
   m(m(x,y),z) = m(x, m(y,z));
   # properties of join
   j(x,x) = x;
   j(x,y) = j(y,x);
   j(j(x,y),z) = j(x, j(y,z));
   # absorption laws
   m(x,j(x,y)) = x;
   j(x,m(x,y)) = x;
